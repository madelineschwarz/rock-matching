# rock-matching

see original code & work: https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/Rock-Matching

Experiments matching rocks between timeframes using Similarity measures (TS_SS, Eucledian distance)

RM_2_7_NB.ipynb -- Notebook for testing TS_SS on synthetic rock shp-- adjust params to maniupulate rocks in time frame 2 (df3)

RM_functions.py -- Functions for calculating geometric params, similarity measures, and visualization

test_rocks_11_12_22.zip --- zip folder containing the test 'synthetic' rock shapefiles. Here, rocks are represented as 21 ellipses for simplicity
